## If Therapy is Medicine, How Do We Prevent Overdose?

Couples come to our office in distress. They want to feel better. For me, PACT
therapy provides medicine for the couple. PACT is an approach designed to alleviate
the symptoms that come from an insecure, unfair, insensitive relationship that isn’t
operating in a way that works for both partners.
If we define therapy as “medicine,” we need to understand its constitution. What
are its active ingredients? How is dosage determined? What does an overdose look
like?
Have you ever overdosed a couple? I have. I know what that looks like, and I
now know to avoid it.

### Therapy as Medicine
If medicine is “the science and art dealing with the maintenance of health and
prevention, alleviation, or cure of disease” (Merriam-Webster.com), then to me, PACT
therapy is medicine.
PACT has the potency – not as a chemical substance but as a medicinal
approach – that restores and preserves the well-being of the couple relationship. PACT
therapists help couples form a foundation with principles of fairness, justice, sensitivity,
mutuality, and collaboration. As this process unfolds, the couple learns to depend on
one another for survival, enabling both to thrive individually and collectively. 

### Therapist in the Medicine
 If therapy is medicine for the couple, what goes into the medicine? From a
psychobiological perspective, the therapist is a primary component of the medicine. My
facial expressions (either under- or over-expressiveness), vocal tone, language, and
body movement (either the openness or tenseness communicated via movement
toward or away from one or both partners in session) impacts the couple.
Sometimes my belief in a couple’s capacity to improve is enough medicine to
nudge them forward. Other times my deep concern for their future needs expression.
While this therapeutic dosage can seem like a bitter pill to swallow, the communication
leads them into a healthier direction. Videotaping my sessions has offered me additional
information on how my facial expressions and body movements impact the couple.
If what I say and do in the session is a primary component of the medicine, I first
must identify the substance to administer (What is the intervention?). The next step is to
be clear on the dosage (How much?). In order for the medicine to be effective, the dose
must have an opportunity to take effect (How long between dosages?).

### Signs of Overdose
When a couple does not respond to an intervention in a therapy session, they are
saturated. That overdose risk becomes high once a therapist identifies the substance
for the intervention, administers the dose, and then proceeds to introduce another
intervention of some kind. The problem is that the therapist has no way of knowing
which therapeutic action was effective or ineffective. I have done this, and I have seen a
couple overdose as a result.

The goal is to help couples slow down from the impact of an overdose, so be
aware of the signs. Speaking slowly or not at all, looking down (or up), nodding, drinking
water to self-regulate all may be signs that the couple is struggling with too much
stimuli. Many clients consider themselves compliant students of the process, and it can
be shaming to acknowledge they feel lost.
Conversely, how do I know when the substance of an intervention is working?
Clear signs of relief, ease of breath, increased coregulation, brightness in the eyes.
Another positive sign is a subsequent behavior that aligns with the task, or medicine, of
therapy, which is to improve the relationship.

### Overdosing by Doing Too Much
More is not necessarily better when a PACT therapist is working
psychobiologically. And, working slowly often works out better.
For example, doing too much can happen when we stage a conflict in the therapy
session. The process of working sequentially to understand what happened and have
each partner embody their part in the process takes time and attention. Couples can get
diverted and introduce other issues.
As a result, I’ve learned the necessity of staying on track. Otherwise, the
medicine will simply not work. “One thing at a time” is a good prescription to give
couples when they are fighting at home as well.
In addition to the risk of overdosing a couple, we can’t be inspired when we are
doing too much. Consider how we may be regulating our emotions through activity. The
more we move and do, the less we observe.

Furthermore, we are less in touch with the interoceptive cues that can inform us
of implicit content. I struggled with this issue in my development as a PACT therapist.
During the session, I now scan my body for tension, focus externally, and shift my own
body as a way to avoid falling into this trap.
Doing too much can also infantilize the couple. This is bad medicine. As the
therapy progresses, we expect the couple will have their own ideas so they can move
their relationship forward. If a therapist has a consistent stance of doing too much, the
couple may not grow to believe they are capable of managing their relationship without
the therapist’s support.
As a couple begins to operate securely, they will have less need for the medicine
the therapist is providing. This is the implicit goal that therapists must make explicit.

### Overdosing by Saying Too Much
If a therapist is doing too much, they are likely saying too much. When I’m saying
too much, I’m unable to be present and focused on the couple. I miss signs of overdose
along with other implicit and explicit material. Too many words can be difficult for a
couple to absorb and understand, especially if they are already stressed. 
A therapist can overdose a couple by saying a number of things at once, making
it difficult if not impossible to know what the couple absorbed. And, if I say too much, I
cannot be sure what was or wasn’t an effective therapeutic move.
What exactly did I administer in terms of substance? If I’m not able to answer that
question, it sounds like an overdose. 

### Prescriptions and Regulations

When a couple begins therapy, the therapy can’t be the only medicine. In my
experience, when couples practice what they learn in therapy (i.e., take their medicine),
they become secure functioning sooner and more effectively. We can also prescribe
rituals and practices designed around coregulation for couples to do at home. These
practices create new neural pathways in each partner’s brain through an iterative
process.
One of the reasons for longer sessions in PACT is to give the couple time to
relax and prepare for reentry to their life outside of the therapy office. Have you ever
asked a couple what they remember from a past session? Examining the memory
system is like looking into a kaleidoscope. Take steps to reinforce the learning that
occurred in the session. Have the couple briefly review key takeaways – what they
learned or a new skill to practice. Keep what I call “competency cards” near their chairs
so they can write their takeaways down if they choose.
You can titrate up a low dose of therapy, but a couple will have a harder time
recovering from an overdose. “Wait, watch, and wonder” is an important approach we
learn in PACT training. Consider waiting to gain more information before intervening.
When we watch – talking less, learning more – we pay closer attention. As we wonder,
we become inspired. And, to do that, we need to be focused on the couple.
Here are additional ways to avoid overdose:
* Write down what you are thinking as a way to self-regulate during the session. 
* Move your body to change your own state. Make use of a rolling chair to change
your perspective.
* Practice saying less.

* Still yourself. Slow down while partners absorb what is being said.
* Do not administer a medicine (intervention) unless you know the substance you
are administering.
* Videotape your sessions, if possible.
* Remember your therapeutic stance: administer the medicine to the couple (a
two-person intervention system), or support each partner as they administer the
medicine to their partner (a cross-administration of intervention).
PACT therapy is medicine and can help couples get better and enjoy their
lives. Like any other medicine, it requires thoughtful consideration throughout the
process it’s being used. It’s a natural, holistic approach that couples are wired to
provide to each other. Isn’t that the best medicine in the world?
